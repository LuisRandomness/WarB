A data-pack (and an optional client-side resource pack) for Minecraft Java version 1.20.4 and up, made to allow small/vanilla servers to simulate arena shooter games, based on Quake III Arena and Warfork, requiring minimal to no outside mod installation.

This is still in early development stages, so many desired features and functionality are either missing or unstable.

## Roadmap
**WarüÖ±Ô∏è** is planned to have the following modes out of the box:
* Deathmatch (FFA and Teams)
* Instagib
* Capture the Flag
* Domination

These are also going to be accompanied with configurable match settings/modifiers:
* Frag/time/score limits
* Optional stocks option, allowing *'last one standing'* games 
* Speed and jump height settings
